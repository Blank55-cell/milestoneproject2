# Game Tools Hub

This is a small project I'm building to collect simple tools for strategy games. The aim is to make calculators, planners, and quick-reference guides easier to access without digging through long forum posts or spreadsheets.

---

## What This Site Is For
The goal is to keep everything straightforward. Each page focuses on one tool or one topic, with clear explanations and no unnecessary clutter. As the project grows, more tools and guides will be added.

---

## Tools (Work in Progress)
- Healing calculator  
- Stack/army composition helper  
- Resource planning tool  
- Basic commander/bonus reference  

These will be expanded and refined over time.

---

## Games Covered
The project starts with Supremacy 1914, since it's the game I know best. More games may be added later if the tools make sense for them.

---

## Who This Is For
Players who want quick, simple tools without needing to build their own spreadsheets or search through long wiki pages.

## Pages Used in This Project

The site is built using four main HTML pages:

- `index.html` – Homepage with a short intro and links to the rest of the site  
- `game.html` – Overview of supported games and mechanics  
- `guide.html` – Strategy guides, tips, and breakdowns  
- `tools.html` – Interactive tools like calculators and planners

Each page is kept simple and focused. The goal is to make it easy for players to find what they need without clutter or distractions.

## Current Content

Here’s a quick look at what each page currently contains. This will change as more tools and features are added, but this is the state of things right now.

### index.html
The homepage gives a short introduction to the project and links to the main sections. It’s intentionally simple so visitors can get their bearings quickly.

### game.html
This page lists the games the project focuses on. At the moment, it highlights Supremacy 1914, with room to expand as more games or mechanics are added.

### guide.html
A starting point for strategy guides. Right now it just has a brief intro, but it’s where detailed tips, breakdowns, and game‑specific advice will eventually go.

### tools.html
This is where all the calculators and planners will live. For now, it has a placeholder message explaining that the tools are still being built.
